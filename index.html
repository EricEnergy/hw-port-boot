                        <p>
                            Hey there and welcome to my first ever portfolio built with HTML and CSS. Im a Floridian by
                            heart and lived half of my life in the amazing city of Orlando, home of one of Disneys
                            feature
                            animation studios. At an early age my father who was an animator brought home photoshop and
                            since then I have been on a path of creativity ever since. Ive done everything from
                            photography,
                            graphic design, and not my new endevor to become a full stack web developer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I am not at home working on something art related I enjoy running in zig zag lines
                            which
                            helps running from alligators, I also love playing my favorite online game called Rocket
                            Leauge,
                            long boarding, playing guitar, or going out to a new fancy place to eat with my wife.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another thing I enjoy doing is spending time with my various types of animals. I have two
                            huskies, a cat, 3 snakes and nine tarantulas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With any projects I work on, there is a little piece of myself.
                        </p>
